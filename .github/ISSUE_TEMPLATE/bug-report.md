**Please replace the things in italics (_like this_).**

I believe there is a problem with _a feature_, because when _someone_ does the following:

_Steps to reproduce the behavior, like_
_1. Log in_
_2. Click on '....'_
_3. Scroll down to '....'_
_4. See error_

they expected 

_something to happen_

but instead

_something else happened_.

I believe this affects _an amount_ of our users because _a reason_, and they are _a qualifier_ impacted because _another reason_.
